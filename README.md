## IRIS Flowers Classification Using Machine Learning
- In this model of Iris Flowers Classification, we will be using  Logistic Regression Machine Learning Algorithm.
- In this model Iris Dataset is use, and it contains features of different flower species. Independent features in this dataset are Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and    Petal Width. And Dependent feature, which will be the output for the model, is Species. It contains the name of the species to which that particular flower with those        measurements belongs.

## Logistic Regression
- Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning model used mainly for categorical data, and it is a classification algorithm. It is one of the widely used algorithms for classification using machine learning. Logistic Regression is used to find the relationship between dependent and independent variables. This is done by using a logistic regression equation. 

## Model Building
- Import libraries - Pandas, Numpy , Matplotlib
- Perform Preprocessing of Data
- **Label enocding** : It  is a technique that is used to convert categorical columns into numerical ones so that they can be fitted by machine learning models which only take numerical data. It is an important pre-processing step in a machine-learning project.
- Split the Data Into Train and Test Datasets.
- Building classification Model with the help of logistic regression classifier.
- Checking accuracy of model
- Evaluating Performance of model
